This is a toy example project for experimenting with techniques to make Scala projects more approachable.

See the example at [Cats XorT Mini-Tutorial](./core/docs/example.md)

The documentation was generated using 
https://github.com/tpolecat/tut

The custom advice provided on compile error was implemented with
https://github.com/softwaremill/scala-clippy
along with the compiler message -> advice mappings stored in [.clippy.json](./.clippy.json)

To regenerate core/docs/example.md run:
```
sbt tut
```
